Data types can be split into 2.
Primitive and Non-Primitive

Primitive data types are
Numbers
Strings
Booleans
Null
Undefined
Symbol

Non-Primitive data types are
Objects
Arrays

Primitive data types are NON-Modifiable. Once it is created we cant change it example
let word = 'JavaScript'

trying to modify the string that stores word, should throw and error. Any datatype under a Single Quote, Double Quote, or Backtick Quote is a String.
word[0] = 'Y'

Numbers are integers and decimal values which can do all the arithmetic operations. Let's see some examples of Numbers.


\n is newline
\t is a TAB (8 spaces)
\\ backslash
\' single Quote
\" double Quote|

console.log('I hope everyone is enjoying the 30 Days Of JavaScript challenge.\nDo you ?') // line break
console.log('Days\tTopics\tExercises')
console.log('Day 1\t3\t5')
console.log('Day 2\t3\t5')
console.log('Day 3\t3\t5')
console.log('Day 4\t3\t5')
console.log('This is a backslash  symbol (\\)') // To write a backslash
console.log('In every programming language it starts with \"Hello, World!\"')
console.log("In every programming language it starts with \'Hello, World!\'")
console.log('The saying \'Seeing is Believing\' isn\'t correct in 2020')
